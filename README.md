## What is it ?

A Small MVC Framework.

This framework was done during a school session.
The subject was to create a website using JavaScript, a Database like MySQL,
CSS (with @media), and some Ajax request using jquery...
To did it, I needed one night :). 

So we (me & two friend), decided to create your own framework. In fact, it's 
a small framework inspired from differents anothers frameworks (CakePHP, Laravel, ...).
I did the design of this application and wrote a good part of it. Then, me and Quentin 
adjusted it to be what we needed and wanted.

The purpose was to design and write a MVC Framework instead of write some PHP 
in some files as I did when I was 14 years old. Moreover, one of my friend was
not good in MVC design, so this Framework was quite rewarding for him.

The name of the framework is not important, it came from a joke between us :)

## Thanks

First, thanks for the open source community ! Without it, I can't be curious,
I can't learn, I can't be better. Without the open source, I will know nothing.

Thanks for Quentin Douziech & Bastien Gibrat, my mates.

Thanks for Xavier Mouly to accept your request to do more than a small website which
meet his expectations.
